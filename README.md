## Setup

**1. Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fr4ct4ldemo/Glorious
cd Glorious
```

**2. Configure the bot**

Edit `config.json` — this is the only file you need to touch:

```json
{
    "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
    "stock-command-silent": false,
    "remove-capture-from-stock": true,
    "commands-give-cooldown": true,
    "default_cooldown": 5,
    "stock-storage-path": "/stock_data",
    "subscription-stages": ["Free", "Premium"],
    "messages": {
        "altsent": "Thank you for using Glorious",
        "footer-msg": "Your footer text here"
    },
    "generate-settings": {
        "gif-img-url": "https://your-gif-url-here"
    },
    "maximum-file-size": 2097152
}
```

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `token` | Your Discord bot token |
| `stock-command-silent` | If `true`, `/stock` is only visible to the user who ran it |
| `remove-capture-from-stock` | Strip capture groups from accounts on add |
| `default_cooldown` | Fallback cooldown in seconds if no role cooldown is set |
| `stock-storage-path` | Folder path where stock `.txt` files are stored |
| `subscription-stages` | List of subscription tiers (first = free tier) |
| `maximum-file-size` | Max upload size for `/addstock` in bytes (default 2MB) |

**3. Run the bot**

```bash
python run.py
```

---

## Landing Page / Web Dashboard

Glorious includes a public landing page built with Flask that serves as the bot's invite page.

**Starting the dashboard**

```bash
cd dashboard
python app.py
```

The landing page runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

**Landing page features**

- Public invite page for Glorious with hero section, features, and how it works
- Live stats pulled from the bot's database — real server count, user count, and accounts generated
- Public stats API at `/api/stats` that returns live numbers for the page
- Neon green on dark aesthetic with animated grid background and count-up stats

**Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file inside the `dashboard/` folder and paste the following:

```dotenv
PORT=5000
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/callback
```

> ⚠️ Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub. Add it to `.gitignore` to keep your credentials safe.

---

## Adding Stock

1. Create a `.txt` file with one account per line, e.g.:
```
email@example.com:password123
user2@mail.com:pass456
```

2. Run `/addstock` in Discord, select the service name, and upload the file.

The bot supports both file-based stock (`stock_data/`) and database stock simultaneously — it pulls from files first, then falls back to the database.

---

## Admin Role vs Server Admin

A user counts as an admin if they have:
- Discord's built-in **Administrator** permission, **OR**
- A role that was added via `/setup adminrole`

Admins bypass cooldowns, channel restrictions, subscription checks, and blacklists.

---

## Notes

- Slash commands may take up to **1 hour** to appear globally after first adding the bot. Restart Discord if they're missing.
- Do **not** modify `glorious.py` unless you know what you're doing — all configuration is in `config.json`.
- Stock files are stored in the path set by `stock-storage-path` in config, organized by `<guild_id>/<service_name>.txt`.
- The dashboard runs separately from the bot — you need to start both `run.py` and `dashboard/app.py`.
